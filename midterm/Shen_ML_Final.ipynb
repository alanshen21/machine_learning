Manifold is similar to PCA but it operates in a multidimensional space. Clustering splits the observations into homogenous subgroups based on relative distance between data points."

Third, in a CNN, the number of parameters are reduced by sharing weights which improves its image processing efficiency and capability compared to MLP. "
